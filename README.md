# BackwardsPython
Reverses all the source code in a .py file and turns it into a .bpy file which can then be executed.

This is probably the quickest, dumbest, and most useless project I have ever done.

Why would you use this?:
  Honestly idk, maybe as some sorta weak but fast encrypter.

Why did I create this project?:
  1. Just as a way to fill up my github repository.
  2. Time killer
  3. My friend was messing around with BrainFuck, Blub and other weird programming languages.
